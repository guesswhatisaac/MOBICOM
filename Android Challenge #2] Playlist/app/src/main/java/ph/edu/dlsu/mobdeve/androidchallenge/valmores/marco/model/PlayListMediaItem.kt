/*  Do not modify any declared variables and methods included in this class.
 *
 * The PlayListMediaItem acts as the model for our problem. A media item contains an ID, title,
 *  media type, and media duration. The ID is represented as an integer, while the other variables
 *  are represented as Strings. The class has three constructors of which you're free to use (or not
 *  use). The primary constructor requires all variables be provided, while the others provide a
 *  default ID (i.e. -1). Please note that all variables are not private, so they can be set outside
 *  of the class.
 *
 *  Please also note that there is no validity checking for mediaDuration. It is assumed the input
 *  is correct. However, for mediaType, please make sure that only "AUDIO" or "VIDEO" are specified.
 *  This value is case insensitive, so values like "audio" or "Video" are also allowed.
